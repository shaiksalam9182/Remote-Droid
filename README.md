# Remote-Droid
This app works like a remote for the pc's.The user who want to control their pc have to add the ip address and port given in the java file into the app.Then these are stored in phone memory.Then the app connect to the pc using socket.By using sockets we can send commands to the pc in  a strem.Then the pc will receive the commands and it will act on that commands.
